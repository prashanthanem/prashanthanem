### Hi there! 😁

My name is Prashanth Anem from India (🇮🇳). I've been working as Front-End Developer since 2015 and currently I'm Senior Front-End Developer at [Tata Consultancy. Services]. I'm passionate about open source projects and I've always loved to produce a lot of content during my career.

In my free time I like to play (and watch) cricket (🏏), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I like to philosophize about life with a coffee (☕️).

Would you like to find me?
